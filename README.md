## fundamentalsQuizForJS
 Created a JavaScript quiz that is timed with ten questions that are randomly selected. When the player or quiz taker selects the answer, it will color change to let them know if the answer is correct or incorrect.

For each correct answer the score will increased by 10 points for a maximum score of 100.  If a wrong answer is chosen then the player is penalized by 5 seconds being removed from the time.  

Quiz ends when all answers are answered or time gets down to zero, which ever happens first.

See below for User Story and Acceptance Criteria that was followed.
